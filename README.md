# Gymster
## About
Gymster is a web application that can be used to share training plan with others.

## Run application
To run this aplication, you need docker and docker compose. All you have to do is run:
```
docker-compose up
```
And after that, you can see the application screen under URL: [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

## Database
Application is using PostgreSQL database. Here you can see the structure of database: [ERD](https://github.com/Klosowsky/Gymster/blob/master/gymster_erd.pdf).<br>
The dump of database can be found in file: [dump](https://github.com/Klosowsky/Gymster/blob/master/dump.sql).

## Users
In dump data, I provided two example users:
| username | password | privilege |
| ---------| -------- | --------- |
| admin    | admin    | admin     |
| user     | user123  | user      |<br>

There are two roles for users, admin and normal user.

## User interface
I started from creating design of application in Adobe XD. Result can be found here: [design](https://github.com/Klosowsky/Gymster/blob/master/gymster_design.pdf).<br>
User interface is fully responsive. That means application can be used also on phones.<br>
During the development process I leave some of ideas, mostly because of small amount of time.
